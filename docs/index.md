# About

The interdisciplinary seminar ["Computational Design and Digital Fabrication"](https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/df/teaching/computational-design-and-fabrication/) aims to bridge fundamental principles of geometric computation and structural design and use these insights to develop new algorithms and tools for robotic fabrication in architecture. At the interface of the disciplines of architecture, structural design and engineering, and digital fabrication, students are taught innovative computational design solutions for advanced digital construction techniques at various scales.

The aim of the course in the summer semester of 2023 is to explore the formal and constructive potential of reciprocal frame structures and the potential of cooperative human-robot teams for the in-place assembly of such structures. In this context, we will deal with the computational design of a reciprocal frame structure using digital form-finding and generative growth algorithms. For fabrication, we will deploy a centralized cloud-based task manager to coordinate both humans and robots to carry out assembly tasks. At the end of the seminar, the full-scale production of a prototype of this canopy structure is planned in the Collaborative Construction Laboratory of TUM. This structure will be exhibited at the [Future of Construction Symposium](https://futureofconstruction.net/) in September 2023.
